# 👋 Welcome to My Tech Journey

Hi, I'm **Presideo Okuguni** — a passionate and driven IT professional currently completing the **Technology Support Professional Program** at the **British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT)**. With a strong focus on **Network and Systems Administration**, my training combines theory with hands-on experience in real-world lab environments.

This website is a reflection of my **learning journey**, **technical growth**, and **commitment to building a future in IT support, cybersecurity, and cloud infrastructure**.

🔧 **Currently, I'm working on my Capstone Project**, where I’m applying everything I’ve learned to design, secure, and document a functional IT infrastructure solution. It’s a culmination of my skills in networking, system administration, and technical problem-solving — and I look forward to sharing updates as the project evolves.
